# 🧠 Raspberry Pi Temperature & Humidity Monitor

This smart home automation project represents the codebase to collect physical data inside my little garden greenhouse from multiple sensors connected to a Raspberry Pi 4 — including temperature, humidity and soil moisture.  
The application runs inside a lightweight **Docker container** and can be reproduced by following the setup as described below. Dependency management is done with **Poetry**.

All sensor readings are periodically collected, logged, and displayed via a 16x2 lcd display for arduino or raspberry pi.  
Each DS18B20 temperature sensor is uniquely identified by its 1-Wire address, allowing you to label them (e.g., *inside* / *outside*) without needing multiple GPIO pins.

Currently, this MVP includes mainly displaying sensor values on the display to indicate if certain actions on the greenhouse are required (watering, ventilation). The idea is to build a fully automated system to minimize manual work in the greenhouse as well as implementing a full-on web application from scratch to monitor and control every sensor remotely.

## 🧩 Hardware Setup

- **Raspberry Pi** (any model with GPIO support, I use Pi 4 Model B) with ubuntu 24.04 lts
- **micro SD card** for ubuntu & storage on Raspberry Pi (I use 32GB)
- **1× DHT11** sensor
- **2× DS18B20** temperature sensors, water resistant
- **1× 10 kΩ pull-up resistor** between the DS18B20 data line and 3.3 V
- **Jumper cables & breadboard** for sensor connections
- **Case for raspberry & main case for display & cables** however you want, just DIY

## </> OS & Software Setup

### 1. Install ubuntu (desktop)

Follow the instructions on https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/how-to-install-ubuntu-desktop-on-raspberry-pi-4#1-overview to install ubuntu (24.04) on the micro SD card. It's not necessary to use ubuntu desktop (shh also possible), but this way I can implement/control everything directly on the raspberry.

### 2. Repository setup

Connect to git and checkout this repository (check git documentations). Install Python 3.13 and create a virtual environment by navigating to this repo and run ```python -m venv .venv```. Activate the environment by calling ```source .venv/bin/activate```. If no poetry.lock file is present in the repo, run ````poetry lock``` and then ```poetry install``` to install every dependency needed for this project directly in the virtual environment.
